#Dhikr Counter Web App

This project is a simple, interactive web application designed to help users keep track of their Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) counts for each of the five daily prayers: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. The app provides a user-friendly interface with buttons to increment the count and save it under the corresponding prayer time.

Features:
Increment Button: Users can click this button to increase the Dhikr count.
Save Button: Saves the current count under the next prayer time in sequence.
Reset Button: Resets all counts to zero, allowing the user to start over.
Responsive Design: Ensures a smooth user experience across different devices.
Stylish Background: Features a visually appealing background image with a blur effect.
Smooth Transitions: Buttons slightly enlarge when hovered over to enhance interactivity.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the content.
CSS: For styling the application, including hover effects and background image.
JavaScript: For dynamic functionality, including incrementing counts, saving counts to specific prayer times, and resetting the counts.
This project is ideal for individuals who wish to keep track of their Dhikr counts in a structured manner, with a straightforward and elegant interface.
